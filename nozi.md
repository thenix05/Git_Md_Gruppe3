##  About me

I am a computer scientist who specializes in application development, but sometimes I also like to make projects with hardware. I develop games and useful utilities which aid in everyday life. I also make 3D objects for 3D-printing.
I do that as a hobby and am unhireable.

### 2048 in Python

A small game of 2048 made 100% in python. It comes complete with GUI, soundtracks and controller support and even some fun little animations.
As an additional challenge I made the gui completely with the turtle module. The sound is being played with pygame.
